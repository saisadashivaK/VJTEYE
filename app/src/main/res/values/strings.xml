    <string name="siteInfo">Prior to 1960, Victoria Jubilee Technical Institute was the only institute offering Engineering degree and postgraduate courses under the University of Bombay and enjoyed de facto autonomy. In 1997, the institute was renamed to Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute.

The institute was granted financial and academic autonomy from 21 June 2004. As a result, the autonomous VJTI has implemented a revised syllabus for its students in June 2004 at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels by implementing a credit system. The revised scheme of examinations, which follows a grading system and letter grade point system has been implemented. An important part of curriculum is the practically oriented project at the final year of graduation and the dissertations offered by the postgraduate students, as also the in-plant training undergone by the third year Diploma students.Significant changes under autonomy are the setting up of Distance Education Programmes (DEP) with IIT Bombay, with VJTI being a Remote Centre; as also the modernization of the library to a digital library. Postgraduate students may see the journals online throughout the week, with facility for printing. Several students societies, inter-college festivals, and the college magazine Nirmaan serve as a platform to enhance students personality. VJTI initiated a newsletter named VJ.News in March 2010.  </string>
